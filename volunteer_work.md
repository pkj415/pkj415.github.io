**Volunteer, Utkarsh ([nirmaan.org](https://nirmaan.org/))** \| *Aug 2014 - Aug 2015, @ Pilani*

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Utkarsh Scholarship Program is a part of Nirmaan Pilani, a non-profit organization. The project focuses on providing scholarships to financially distressed meritorious students studying in various schools of Pilani to decrease the dropout rate of students. I was part of a team that conducted scholarship tests for various classes, mentored students, and organized events for the beneficiaries.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Laid the roadmap for the project for the upcoming semester. Successfully provided scholarships and mentorship to 72 financially weak school students from 5 schools of villages near Pilani.</p>

**Member, Prayogshala ([nirmaan.org](https://nirmaan.org/))** \| *Oct 2015 - May 2015 @ Pilani*

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Worked on an idea to create self-sustained activity-based learning spaces for school students. It is basically a resource-room with toolkits from various fields like mathematics, science, and arts where school students can experiment and learn by activities. It aims at arousing the curiosity of students and providing an inquisitive way of looking at subjects, so as to provide a deeper insight to students that schools generally miss out at. The concept has evolved after a lot of brain-storming discussions and hard work. We had setup-up the space for Prayogshala in the winter vacation and now are conducting Sunday Camps with 24 students of 4 different schools based on themes such as Optics & Photography, Art & Drama, Democracy & Civilizations and Aerodynamics. Engaging in such activities has developed my skills of working with people and understanding different perspectives.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Technology has grown in many forms and can be made accessible almost to all. It is just a luxury for some but can ease the life of many and can be the key to solving some of the most pressing issues faced by the country today. We just need some ideas and tinkering to apply it on the field.

It is only by solving basic problems that development will occur collectively in every community and not selectively. Dhiti (sanskrit for “An idea”) is a platform for passionate individuals who ideate and aspire for technology to reach the grassroots. I worked with a team of volunteers from Nirmaan Organization, Pilani to plan Dhiti.</p>
