<p style="text-align:justify;"> I am currently a student (MS in CS) at the University of Texas at Austin. I spent my school years in Chennai, India and did my undergrad studies in CS at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. I later worked for 2 years at Nutanix. </p>

## Current Interests:

- Distributed systems
- Databases
- Sustainability

## Current work:

* [Model checking of distributed protocols using TLA+](https://pkj415.github.io/TLA-Protocols/)

* [Trusted plastic recycling]((https://github.com/pkj415/recycle_demo)) - Resolving the issue of lack of trust among donors of money in a platic recycling supply chain using a private blockchain. (I will shortly update this link with a detailed explanation of how exactly I am solving the issue of lack trust.)

* Porting TAS (TCP Acceleration as an OS service) to a Netronome smart NIC (with [Rajath Shashidhara](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rajaths/) under the supervision of [Prof. Simon Peter](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/))).
